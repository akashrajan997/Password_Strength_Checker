# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This codebase currently consists of a single file, `app.py`, which appears to be a placeholder or demonstration script. The file contains a series of print statements, each outputting a string related to various features, including some that reference a "testing branch."

## Key Patterns and Conventions
- The main entry point is `app.py`.
- There are no functions, classes, or external dependencies in the current codebase.
- The codebase does not use any frameworks, configuration files, or tests at this time.
- There is no build or deployment process defined.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- If expanding this project, follow standard Python project structure: group related logic into functions and classes, and use modules as the codebase grows.
- When adding new features, prefer clear, descriptive print statements or logging for demonstration purposes.
- If introducing dependencies, document them in a `requirements.txt` file and update this instruction file accordingly.
- If you add tests, place them in a `tests/` directory and use `pytest` as the default test runner unless otherwise specified.
- If you add configuration, prefer `.env` or `config.ini` files and document their usage here.

## Example: Adding a Feature
To add a new feature, append a new print statement to `app.py`:

```python
print("feature12")
```

## Next Steps
- Update this file as the project evolves, especially when new files, dependencies, or workflows are introduced.
- If you add a README or other documentation, reference it here for further guidance.
